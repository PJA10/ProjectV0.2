; This file contains errors in .struct directives and struct operands.

; Each line (except a few) contains an error in the assembly language code.
; A comment preceding each line explains the error.

; All errors should be detectable in the first pass of the assembler.

; Run the assembler on this file, and verify that it catches all the errors.
; Your assembler messages need not be identical to the comments in this file.

; Disclaimer: this list of errors is not exhaustive; 
;             you are encouraged to identify additional errors.
